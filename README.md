- 👋 Hi, I’m @vincedinh
- 🌱 I’m currently a 3rd year Computer Science B.S. and Business Management Economics B.A. double major at University of California, Santa Cruz.
  - I'm interested in learning more about front-end development, computer graphics (AR/VR included), and e-commerce. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects on the Oculus Quest platform! I find the developing field of VR fascinating.
- 🖍 In my free time, I like designing my own clothes, longboarding at the beach, playing games, taking photos, watching sitcoms and anime, and traveling with  friends!
